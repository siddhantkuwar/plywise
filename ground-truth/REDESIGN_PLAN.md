# Redesign Plan

> Historical plan for the workstation redesign. Current work is governed by `WEB_ROADMAP.md`.

## Strategy

Use an incremental vertical slice, not a glorious one-shot rewrite followed by three days locating the Analyze button.

## 0. Audit

Deliver actual stack, C++ topology, routes, contracts, working/broken features, commands, screenshots, and risks. No broad changes.

## 1. Documentation migration

Create ignored archive, install ground truth, repair links, and produce migration report.

## 2. Design foundation

Themes, tokens, typography, spacing, focus, primitives, shell, sidebar, empty/error states.

## 3. Recent Games

Import, list, selection, analyze action, batch status, empty and failure states.

## 4. Analysis vertical slice

```text
Recent game → Analyze → real progress → completed review
→ navigate → evaluation/class/opening/accuracy
→ reveal best move → branch variation → return
```

This proves product identity and the C++ boundary.

## 5. Settings

Engine lines, retry, variation assistance, patterns, technical details, coaching style, depth, MultiPV, CPU, hash, and theme. Controls must connect to real behavior or be labeled unavailable.

## 6. Explore

Only real-data-backed recommendations, libraries, and empty states.

## 7. Progress

Rating, trends, weaknesses, openings, patterns, sample size, and freshness. Never invent data to keep charts company.

## 8. QA

Screenshot matrix, interactions, accessibility, regressions, performance notes, and known gaps.

## Gates

Do not advance while analysis is broken, contracts are unclear, app does not build, visual states are unverified, or old/new component systems coexist without a removal plan.
